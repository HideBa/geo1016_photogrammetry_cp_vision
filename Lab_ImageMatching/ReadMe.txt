This code include two examples:
  - Example_1: Real time image matching 
  - Example_2: Image stitching based on image matching. 


The code depends on [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (v4.x has been tested). OpenCV implements basic computer vision algorithms, linear algebra, image/video manipulation, and GUI. Please check the links below for the installation of OpenCV:
